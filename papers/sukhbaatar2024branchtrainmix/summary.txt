 * The paper proposes Branch-Train-MiX (BTX), a method for training Large Language Models (LLMs) that can specialize in multiple domains such as coding, math, and world knowledge.
* BTX starts by branching a seed model to train experts in parallel with high throughput and reduced communication cost.
* After individual experts are trained, BTX combines their feedforward parameters as experts in Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) layers and averages the remaining parameters.
* BTX then finetunes the MoE layers to learn token-level routing, which is not present in the Branch-Train-Merge method.
* BTX generalizes two special cases, the Branch-Train-Merge method and sparse upcycling, which omits the stage of training experts asynchronously.
* BTX achieves the best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to alternative approaches.
* Recent work has proposed the Branch-Train-Merge (BTM) method for embarrassingly parallel training of LLMs without synchronization, but its main drawback is the lack of a unified single model for further finetuning.
* The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach reduces the computational footprint of LLMs by keeping only a subset of parameters active at any given time, allowing the total number of parameters to grow without additional computation.
* MoE has shown impressive performance on downstream tasks, but it is often trained in a fully synchronized manner.
* BTX combines the benefits of both BTM and MoE, allowing for efficient and effective training of LLMs that can specialize in multiple domains while still being finetuned for specific tasks.
