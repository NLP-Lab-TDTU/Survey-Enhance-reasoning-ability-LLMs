 * The paper proposes Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), a simple algorithm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
* ReST is inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning and is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because it produces the training dataset offline, allowing data reuse.
* The ReST method consists of two steps: Grow and Improve. During the Grow step, a policy generates a dataset, and at the Improve step, the filtered dataset is used to fine-tune the policy.
* The authors focus on the application of ReST to machine translation and show that it can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation.
* ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, and the authors believe it can be used to improve the quality of LLMs' outputs in various tasks.
* The paper highlights the importance of aligning LLMs with human preferences to avoid generating unsafe or harmful contents and to improve performance on downstream tasks.
* The authors also discuss the limitations of ReST, such as the need for a high-quality initial policy and the potential for the reward model to overfit to the human feedback.
* The paper includes experiments and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of ReST in improving the translation quality of LLMs in a compute and sample-efficient manner.
* The authors suggest that ReST can be further improved by incorporating active learning techniques and by exploring different ways of generating the initial policy.
